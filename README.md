# Google Case Competition 2025 – Dynamic Optimization of Google Advertising Staffing Plan

This project was developed by Team **Deep Analytics** (UC Berkeley) and awarded **2nd Place** in the 2025 Google Case Competition. The objective was to optimize staffing plans for Google advertising support teams by balancing **cost, revenue, and service quality** using **Linear Programming** and **Dynamic Programming** models.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The problem addressed staffing inefficiencies caused by fluctuating demand across months. We proposed and implemented:
- A **Linear Programming (LP)** model to determine globally optimal staffing decisions under cost and capacity constraints.
- A **Dynamic Programming (DP)** algorithm to handle interlinked hiring/firing decisions in monthly time steps.
- A **two-stage optimization approach** to further improve forecast accuracy and adaptability.

## 📁 Files Included
- `Poster_draft.pdf` – Final poster summarizing the model, findings, and validated results.
- `LP_Model.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook for the LP-based optimization with added constraints.
- `DP_Model.py` – Python implementation of the Dynamic Programming approach.
- `visualization.ipynb` – Notebook for results visualization.
- `Optimized_Staffing_Results_3.csv` – Cross-validated results used in analysis and poster.

## 📊 Key Results
- Total Revenue: **$151.5M**
- Total Cost: **$34.6M**
- Net Profit: **$117M**
- LP and DP models showed consistent results, validating the optimization framework.

## 📌 Limitations
- Unrealistic hiring/firing assumptions
- Strict wait pool removal policy may lead to revenue loss
- Limited historical data
